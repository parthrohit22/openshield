## Adding a Scan Rule (The Fastest Way to Contribute)

Every misconfiguration rule is a self-contained Python file in `scanner/rules/`.

### Step 1 — Pick an Issue

Browse issues labelled [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/openshield-org/openshield/issues?q=label%3Agood-first-issue) or [`help-wanted`](https://github.com/openshield-org/openshield/issues?q=label%3Ahelp-wanted).

Comment on the issue: **"I'd like to work on this"** — we'll assign it to you.

### Step 2 — Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openshield.git
cd openshield
git checkout -b rule/your-rule-name
```

### Step 3 — Write Your Rule

Create a new file in `scanner/rules/`. Every rule follows this exact template:

```python
"""AZ-STOR-001: Public blob access enabled on storage account."""

from typing import Any, Dict, List

RULE_ID = "AZ-STOR-001"
RULE_NAME = "Public Blob Access Enabled on Storage Account"
SEVERITY = "HIGH"           # HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO
CATEGORY = "Storage"        # Storage / Network / Identity / Database / Compute / Key Vault
FRAMEWORKS = {
    "CIS": "3.5",
    "NIST": "PR.AC-3",
    "ISO27001": "A.9.4.1"
}
DESCRIPTION = (
    "Storage accounts with public blob access enabled allow anyone on the "
    "internet to read data without authentication. This can lead to data "
    "exposure incidents."
)
REMEDIATION = "Disable public blob access on the storage account."
PLAYBOOK = "playbooks/cli/fix_az_stor_001.sh"


def scan(azure_client: Any, subscription_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Return a list of findings. Return [] if no issues are found."""
    findings: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

    for account in azure_client.get_storage_accounts():
        if getattr(account, "allow_blob_public_access", False):
            findings.append({
                "rule_id": RULE_ID,
                "rule_name": RULE_NAME,
                "severity": SEVERITY,
                "category": CATEGORY,
                "resource_id": account.id,
                "resource_name": account.name,
                "resource_type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
                "description": DESCRIPTION,
                "remediation": REMEDIATION,
                "playbook": PLAYBOOK,
                "frameworks": FRAMEWORKS,
                "metadata": {}
            })

    return findings
```

That's it. One file, one rule.

### Step 4 — Add a Remediation Playbook

Create the matching fix in `playbooks/cli/`:

```bash
# playbooks/cli/fix_az_stor_001.sh

#!/bin/bash
# Disable public blob access on a storage account
# Usage: ./fix_az_stor_001.sh <resource-group> <storage-account-name>

RESOURCE_GROUP=$1
STORAGE_ACCOUNT=$2

az storage account update \
  --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --allow-blob-public-access false

echo "Public blob access disabled for $STORAGE_ACCOUNT"
```

### Step 5 — Test Your Rule

```bash
# Set up test credentials (use a free Azure trial account)
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-test-subscription
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Run your rule against the test subscription
python -c "
import os
from scanner.azure_client import AzureClient
from scanner.rules import az_stor_001 as rule

client = AzureClient(os.environ['AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'])
findings = rule.scan(client, os.environ['AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'])
print(f'Found {len(findings)} issue(s)')
"
```

### Step 6 — Submit Your PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add rule AZ-STOR-001 public blob access check"
git push origin rule/your-rule-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub. Use this PR template:

```
## What does this PR do?

## Rule ID Convention

Use the format: `AZ-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]`

| Category | Prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | STOR | AZ-STOR-001 |
| Network | NET | AZ-NET-001 |
| Identity | IDN | AZ-IDN-001 |
| Database | DB | AZ-DB-001 |
| Compute | CMP | AZ-CMP-001 |
| Key Vault | KV | AZ-KV-001 |

Check existing rules before picking a number to avoid clashes.

---

## AzureClient Methods

Use the existing wrapper methods in `scanner/azure_client.py` rather than constructing Azure SDK clients directly inside a rule.

| Method | Returns |
|---|---|
| `azure_client.parse_resource_id(resource_id)` | Dict with `resource_group` and `name` |
| `azure_client.get_storage_accounts()` | List of StorageAccount objects |
| `azure_client.get_storage_lifecycle_policy(resource_group, account_name)` | `True` if a lifecycle policy with rules exists, `False` if no policy exists, `None` if the policy cannot be checked |
| `azure_client.get_network_security_groups()` | List of NetworkSecurityGroup objects |
| `azure_client.get_network_interface(resource_group, nic_name)` | NetworkInterface or None |
| `azure_client.get_virtual_networks()` | List of VirtualNetwork objects |
| `azure_client.get_public_ip_addresses()` | List of PublicIPAddress objects |
| `azure_client.get_virtual_machines()` | List of VirtualMachine objects |
| `azure_client.get_postgresql_servers()` | List of PostgreSQL single-server objects |
| `azure_client.get_sql_servers()` | List of Azure SQL Server objects |
| `azure_client.get_sql_server_auditing_policy(resource_group, server_name)` | ServerBlobAuditingPolicy or None |
| `azure_client.get_key_vaults()` | List of Key Vault objects |
| `azure_client.get_service_principals()` | List of role assignments for service principals |
| `azure_client.get_conditional_access_policies()` | List of Conditional Access policy dicts from Microsoft Graph |

Most list methods return an empty list on failure. Methods that fetch one resource or one policy return `None` when the result cannot be determined.

## Local Dev Setup

```bash
# Python 3.10+
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Installs Flask, Azure SDK clients, requests, psycopg2, PyJWT, and PyYAML for CI workflow validation.

# Frontend
# The frontend directory is currently a scaffold. The React dashboard MVP is on the roadmap.

# API
FLASK_APP=api/app.py flask run --debug

# Database (Docker)
docker run --name openshield-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=openshield \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=openshield \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=openshield \
  -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

---

## Code Standards

- Python: follow PEP8, use type hints where possible
- Dashboard work: functional React components only, Tailwind for styling when the dashboard app lands
- Every rule must have a RULE_ID, SEVERITY, FRAMEWORKS mapping, and a remediation playbook
- Every PR must pass the seven GitHub Actions CI checks before merge
- All PRs need at least one reviewer approval before merge

---

## Recognition

Every contributor is listed in the README.

If you contribute 3+ rules or a major feature, you get:
- Named in the project README
- A shoutout on our LinkedIn and Discord
- A reference letter available on request for job/visa applications
