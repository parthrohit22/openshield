    "The storage account has no lifecycle management policy configured. "
    "Without a lifecycle policy, blobs accumulate indefinitely — old data "

    "data with no automatic expiry or tiering in place."
)
REMEDIATION = (
    "Create a lifecycle management policy on the storage account that "
    "transitions blobs to cooler tiers (Cool, Archive) after a defined "
    "number of days, and deletes blobs that exceed the organisation's "
    "maximum retention period. Navigate to: Storage Account > "
    "Data management > Lifecycle management > Add a rule."

    """Detect storage accounts with no lifecycle management policy.

    The Azure Storage Management SDK exposes lifecycle policies via
    ``management_policies.get(resource_group, account_name)``.
    A ResourceNotFound (404) response means no policy exists — this is
    the condition we flag as MEDIUM severity.

    Three-state return from get_storage_lifecycle_policy():
        True  — policy exists and has rules → skip (compliant)
        False — no policy exists → create finding
        None  — permissions error or unexpected failure → skip with warning
                to avoid false positives

    Args:
        azure_client:    An AzureClient instance with all SDK clients
                         pre-configured.
        subscription_id: The Azure subscription ID being scanned.

    Returns:
        A list of finding dicts — one per storage account that has no
        lifecycle policy. Accounts that could not be checked are skipped
        and logged as warnings.
