    """Detect storage account services with incomplete diagnostic logging.

    For each storage account, all three sub-services (blob, queue, table) are
    checked independently. A separate finding is emitted for each service that
    does not have StorageRead, StorageWrite, and StorageDelete all enabled.

    Three-state return from get_storage_service_logging():
        True  — all three log categories enabled → skip (compliant)
        False — one or more categories missing → create finding
        None  — permissions error or unexpected failure → skip with warning
                to avoid false positives

        azure_client:    An AzureClient instance with all SDK clients
                         pre-configured.
        subscription_id: The Azure subscription ID being scanned.

    Returns:
        A list of finding dicts — one per storage service sub-resource that
        does not have full diagnostic logging. Services that could not be
