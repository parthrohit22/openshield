# Test Plan — API-DEP-001
# Render API Deployment and CI Smoke Testing
# ============================================================

## 1. Overview

This test plan covers the verification of the OpenShield API deployment 
to the Render free tier. The goal is to confirm:

- The Render Web Service builds and deploys the Flask app successfully.
- The database is automatically initialized on startup via `init_db`.
- The pre-commit hook and GitHub Actions CI pipeline gate the code properly.
- The CI pipeline is **community-friendly**, allowing forks to pass even without custom secrets.
- Real Azure scan tests are gated behind `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` so contributor CI never depends on live Azure credentials.
- All 23 API edge cases (routing, filtering, authentication) function correctly in the live cloud environment.

## 2. Methodology and Test Rationale

To ensure the highest reliability of the deployment while accommodating free-tier constraints and community contributions, specific methods and test strategies were chosen:

### 2.1 Infrastructure and Pipeline Strategy
* **Targeting Render over Azure F1:** Azure App Service's F1 tier imposes a strict 60 CPU-minute daily cap. Render provides unmetered CPU on the free tier, making it significantly more reliable for demo and development environments.
* **Database Initialization:** The `api/models/finding.py` was updated with an `init_db` method. This method ensures that all required tables (`scans`, `findings`) are created automatically during the first deployment, preventing HTTP 500 errors.
* **Pre-commit Hook:** Fails fast. By running syntax checks and local API smoke tests *before* the commit is allowed, we prevent broken code from polluting the remote branch.
* **Community-Friendly CI Gate:** The GitHub Action is designed to be zero-friction for contributors.
    * **Optional Smoke Tests:** If `JWT_SECRET` is not set (typical for forks), the smoke test step is gracefully skipped rather than failing the build.
    * **Configurable URL:** The `API_URL` is configurable via GitHub Secrets/Variables, defaulting to the main production instance if not provided.
    * **Conditional Real Scan Tests:** TC-13 and TC-14 (real Azure scan execution) only run when `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` and all four Azure credentials are present. This separates API smoke testing from live scan regression testing. Contributor and fork CI always passes safely — real scan validation is reserved for maintainer-controlled deployment pipelines (`dev` and `main` branches).

### 2.2 Token Generation Method
* **Dynamic HS256 Signing:** Instead of using a hardcoded dummy string, the test script dynamically generates a real token signed with the environment's `JWT_SECRET`.
* **Default Secret Alignment:** The smoke test defaults to `change-me-in-production`, matching the API's default. This allows tests to run "out of the box" in local environments without extra configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ABSOLUTE SECURITY REQUIREMENT:** For any production deployment (Render, Azure, etc.), you **MUST** override the default `JWT_SECRET` with a long, random, and unique string. Leaving the default value in place makes your API vulnerable to unauthorized access via token forging.

### 2.3 API Smoke Test Strategy (The 23 Cases)
The 23 test cases were selected to prove the API is structurally sound and resilient:
* **Health Check (TC-01 to TC-03):** Confirms base app connectivity and ensures public routes are not locked.
* **Core Endpoints (TC-04 to TC-17):** Verifies the actual business logic and JSON structure.
* **Auth/Security (TC-18 to TC-19):** Confirms the JWT middleware is strictly enforced.
* **Edge Cases and Resilience (TC-20 to TC-23):** Ensures the app does not crash when given bad input or non-existent routes.

#### Conditional vs Always-Run Tests

| Mode | TC-13 / TC-14 | All others |
|---|---|---|
| Contributor / fork (no `RUN_REAL_SCAN`) | `SKIP` — printed with reason, not a failure | Always run |
| Maintainer deployment (`RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` + Azure credentials) | Run real scan against live subscription | Always run |

Run modes:
```bash
# Contributor / local (no Azure credentials needed)
API_URL=https://openshield-api.onrender.com JWT_SECRET=<secret> python tests/smoke_test.py

# Maintainer — full real scan
API_URL=https://openshield-api.onrender.com JWT_SECRET=<secret> \
  RUN_REAL_SCAN=true \
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<sub-id> \
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<client-id> \
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret> \
  AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id> \
  python tests/smoke_test.py
```

## 3. Files Under Test

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `startup.sh` | Container startup script, DB initialization, and Gunicorn execution |
| `api/models/finding.py` | Added `init_db` to ensure schema existence on startup |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Flexible GitHub Actions workflow (optional smoke tests) |
| `tests/smoke_test.py` | 23-case functional test suite with default secret support |
| `.git/hooks/pre-commit` | Local Git hook enforcing syntax checks and local smoke tests |
| `requirements.txt` | Pinned runtime dependencies — see dependency notes below |

### 3.1 Dependency Notes

| Package | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `msrest==0.7.1` | Kept (explicit pin) | Transitive dependency of `azure-mgmt-rdbms`, `azure-mgmt-sql`, and `azure-mgmt-storage`. These SDK packages have not fully migrated to `azure-core`. Without an explicit pin, Render's clean pip install can resolve a mismatched version and break scan execution. |

---

## 4. Test Environment Setup

### 4.1 Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 installed locally.
- Render account (render.com).
- OpenShield repository cloned locally.
- `.env` file populated locally with a valid `JWT_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Pre-commit hook installed locally (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`).

### 4.2 Create Test Resources in Render
1.  **Render PostgreSQL Database (Free Tier)**
    - Name: `openshield-db`
2.  **Render Web Service (Free Tier)**
    - Connected to your branch.
    - Start Command: `./startup.sh`
    - Environment Variables set: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.

### 4.3 Configure GitHub Secrets
To enable the automated smoke tests in the CI/CD pipeline, you **must** add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**):

| Secret Name | Required for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | All smoke tests | Must match the value set in Render. Used to sign tokens for test requests. |
| `API_URL` | All smoke tests (optional) | Your Render Service URL. Defaults to the main production instance if not set. |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Real scan tests | Azure Subscription ID passed to the scan trigger endpoint. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Real scan tests | Service principal client ID for `DefaultAzureCredential`. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Real scan tests | Service principal secret for `DefaultAzureCredential`. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Real scan tests | Azure AD tenant ID for `DefaultAzureCredential`. |

> **Note:** `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` is set automatically by `deploy.yml` on `dev` and `main` branches. Forks and contributor PRs never set this flag, so TC-13 and TC-14 are always skipped in fork CI regardless of which secrets are present.

## 5. Test Cases

### Part 1: Deployment & Pipeline Infrastructure

**DP-01 — Pre-commit hook enforces checks**
* **Steps:** Modify a file and run `git commit` with the local API turned off, then with it turned on.
* **Expected:** Blocks/warns when API is off; runs the 23-test suite and passes when API is on.

**DP-02 — Render executes startup script successfully**
* **Steps:** Push code to GitHub and monitor Render deployment logs.
* **Expected:** Logs show DB initialization (`Database initialized.`) and Gunicorn starting.

**DP-03 — GitHub Actions CI pipeline passes**
* **Steps:** Push a commit and monitor the GitHub Actions tab.
* **Expected:**
    * **Maintainer repo (`dev`/`main`):** Runs 21 always-on tests + TC-13/TC-14 real scan with `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true`. All 23 pass.
    * **Contributor / fork:** TC-13 and TC-14 show as `SKIP` with a clear reason. 21/21 non-scan tests pass. Workflow exits green.

---

### Part 2: API Smoke Tests (Executed via `smoke_test.py`)

Run the following command against the live URL to execute these tests (contributor mode — TC-13/TC-14 skipped):
```bash
API_URL=https://openshield-api.onrender.com JWT_SECRET=<secret> python tests/smoke_test.py
```

To run the full 23-case suite including real scan tests (maintainer only):
```bash
API_URL=https://openshield-api.onrender.com JWT_SECRET=<secret> \
  RUN_REAL_SCAN=true \
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<sub-id> AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<id> \
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret> AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant> \
  python tests/smoke_test.py
```

#### Health Check
* **TC-01:** GET `/health` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-02:** GET `/health` returns JSON `{"status": "ok"}`.
* **TC-03:** GET `/health` requires no auth token (public route).

#### Findings Endpoint
* **TC-04:** GET `/api/findings` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-05:** GET `/api/findings` returns a `findings` key in JSON.
* **TC-06:** GET `/api/findings` returns a numeric `count` key.
* **TC-07:** GET `/api/findings?severity=HIGH` correctly filters results.
* **TC-08:** GET `/api/findings?severity=INVALID` handles bad input safely (returns 200 or 400).

#### Score Endpoint
* **TC-09:** GET `/api/score` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-10:** GET `/api/score` returns a numeric score.
* **TC-11:** GET `/api/score` ensures the score is mathematically between 0 and 100.

#### Scans Endpoint
* **TC-12:** GET `/api/scans` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-13:** *(Conditional — requires `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` and Azure credentials)* POST `/api/scans/trigger` returns HTTP 200, 201, or 202. Skipped in contributor/fork CI.
* **TC-14:** *(Conditional — requires `RUN_REAL_SCAN=true` and Azure credentials)* POST `/api/scans/trigger` returns a `scan_id` or `job_id`. Skipped in contributor/fork CI.

#### Compliance Endpoints
* **TC-15:** GET `/api/compliance/cis` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-16:** GET `/api/compliance/nist` returns HTTP 200.
* **TC-17:** GET `/api/compliance/iso27001` returns HTTP 200.

#### Auth & Security Edge Cases
* **TC-18:** GET `/api/findings` without any auth header returns HTTP 401.
* **TC-19:** GET `/api/findings` with a malformed JWT returns HTTP 401.

#### General Edge Cases
* **TC-20:** GET `/nonexistent-endpoint-xyz` returns HTTP 404 (requires auth to pass middleware).
* **TC-21:** POST `/api/scans/trigger` with an empty JSON body returns HTTP 400 (missing `subscription_id`) without crashing.
* **TC-22:** GET `/api/findings?limit=0` does not crash the server.
* **TC-23:** All valid endpoint responses include the `application/json` Content-Type.

## 6. Cleanup

Render Free Tier Web Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The Free PostgreSQL database will automatically be deleted by Render after 90 days. To clean up manually, delete both resources from the Render dashboard Settings page.
